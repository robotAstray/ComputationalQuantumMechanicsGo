### Computational Quantum Mechanics
Exercises from "Computational Quantum Mechanics" by Joshua Izaac &amp; Jingbo Wang. My programming language of choice is Golang. *NOTE*: The book uses Python and Fortran throughout.

**Note**, majority of the code I have written describes/corresponds to the content of the book. My solutions to exercises from the book have filename starting with `Ex`.
